# Granular Materials - Acoustics (GranMA)

GranMA molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and post-processing package used for modeling and analyzing the effects of granular packing on acoustic wave propagation. a

There are three main stages to the workflow.
1. Create packings.
2. Simulation with packings.
3. Post-processing of data of the simulation.
