# Granula Material Analysis (GranMA)

GranMA is an advanced simulation and data analysis package for the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/), designed to provide insights into granular material dynamics. It is compatible with Windows, Linux, and MacOS platforms.

The GranMA ecosystem includes a variety of functionalities:

- **Data Simulation:** GranMA allows for the simulation of granular materials under various conditions, providing detailed insights into their behavior.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyze simulation data to extract meaningful patterns and trends, including frequency, attenuation, and wave number changes.
- **Visualization:** Create detailed plots to visualize the results, aiding in the understanding of complex dynamics.


To learn more, we invite you to visit the documentation at [docs.granma.org](http://docs.granma.org/stable/).

## Installation

To get started with GranMA, install the package using Julia's package manager. You can install the latest release of GranMA as follows:

```julia
julia>]
pkg> add GranMA
```

Check the installed version:

```julia
]st GranMA
```

Start using the package:

```julia
using GranMA
```

## Examples

Here are a few examples to get you started with GranMA. For more detailed information, please refer to [the documentation](http://docs.granma.org/stable/).

### Basic Simulation

```julia
using GranMA

# Set up simulation parameters
parameters = SimulationParameters(
    pressure = 0.01,
    omega = 1.0,
    gamma = 0.1
)

# Run the simulation
result = run_simulation(parameters)

# Visualize results
plot_results(result)
```

### Advanced Analysis

<details>
  <summary>Show Code</summary>

```julia
using GranMA

# Load simulation data
data = load_data("path/to/simulation_output.mat")

# Perform frequency analysis
frequency_results = analyze_frequencies(data)

# Plot frequency spectrum
plot_frequency_spectrum(frequency_results)
```
